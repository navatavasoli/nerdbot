## What is NerdBot?
**NerdBot** is an LLM that uses OpenAI's APIs to parse through snippets of user-entered code and helps to explain it to you line by line.

## How to run
**NerdBot is purely educational and is not intended for professional use.** It is still in its extremely early phases and is only being used as a mechanism of learning AI and machine learning by the developer -- please do **not** rely on it!

Install python using Homebrew (most reliable):

On Mac:
```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Then:
```
$ brew install python
```

Homebrew will automatically install **pip** which is going to point to Python 3 automatically. 

### Current updates

Version 1.1.1
At this point in development I've only implemented basic API interactions. I am planning to use the AWS cloud and a basic GUI to enhance the user experience further.
